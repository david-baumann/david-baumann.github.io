	title = {Inequality in {Data} and {Methodology}},
	abstract = {The focus of this thesis is not on the social and welfare effects of economic distribution, but on the data, which underlies many of the works that discuss inequality. Within a frame of definitions and trends, I present and compare the available data sources and methodolo-gy fuelling the current discourse on inequality. The structure of the paper follows this em-pirical process; starting with the subjectâ€™s relevance and definitions of inequality, I then asses the multiple facets of currently available data, as well as the applied statistical meth-ods. I conclude with a brief demonstration of the variability in outcomes these small as-pects in data aggregation and treatment cause.},

	title = {The {Kyoto} {Protocol} as a {Primary} {Driver} of {Greenhouse} {Gas} {Emissions} {Embodied} in {International} {Trade} {Flows}},
	abstract = {International Climate Change treaties like the Kyoto Protocol traditionally focus on domestic or production-based (PBA) greenhouse gas emissions. However, because emissions footprints are increasingly international in origin, this study examines whether the regulatory focus on territorial emission also leads to reductions in con-sumption-based (CBA) emissions, that is, in global emissions footprints of domestic consumption. The main contribution of this paper will be a closer examination of the effect of Kyoto Protocol ratification on the amount of greenhouse gas emissions em-bodied in international trade flows. This is achieved by first deriving trade embodied greenhouse gas emissions from the EORA environmentally extended global multi-region input-output (MRIO) table. And, in a second step, by specifying a gravity model to pinpoint the relevant drivers of these trade embodied emissions flows. I have found support for the hypothesis that joint ratification of the Kyoto Protocol decreases the amount of greenhouse gases embodied in trade flows. However, this result must be restricted to pairs where at least one country is part of the Annex B list of developed countries with binding emissions targets. On the other hand, trade between countries that do not have binding reduction targets under the Protocol (i.e. Non-Annex B coun-tries) appears to capture some of the emissions that are no longer traded with those that do. I also find weak support for the Environmental Kuznet Curve (EKC), as well as the Pollution Haven Hypothesis (PHH).},
